OBJECTIVE
The objective of this internship project is to explore and analyze a comprehensive traffic accident dataset to uncover key patterns and insights that influence road safety. By performing detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on various factors such as weather conditions, road type, traffic density, driver demographics, and accident severity, this project aims to identify significant relationships and trends that could potentially improve accident prediction models. Through visualizations and data transformations, the project seeks to provide actionable insights that can guide policy-making and contribute to safer road environments.

KEY ACTIVITIES 
* Inspecting the Data Structure -Examine the datasetâ€™s structure, summary statistics, and missing values.
* Univariate Analysis -Histograms for Driver_Age and Driver_Experience are created using sns.histplot().
* Multivariate Analysis -sns.pairplot() visualizes relationships between Driver_Age, Driver_Experience, Speed_Limit, Number_of_Vehicles, and Accident_Severity.
* Correlation Analysis -df.corr() computes correlations between features like Driver_Age, Driver_Experience, Speed_Limit, etc., A heatmap is generated using sns.heatmap() to visualize these correlations.
* Outlier Detection -Boxplots (sns.boxplot()) are used to detect outliers, especially in features like Driver_Age.
